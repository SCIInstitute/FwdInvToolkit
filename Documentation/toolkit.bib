                 ECG signals on the thorax, as well as electrograms on
                 both endocardium and epicardium. The source
                 representation of the myocardial electric activity is
                 the equivalent double layer. The transfer factors
                 between the electric sources and the resulting
                 potentials on the heart surface as well as on the body
                 surface were computed using a realistic thorax model.
                 RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The resulting transfer factors
                 were implemented in a simulation program. The program
                 allows the user to make interactive changes in the
                 timing of depolarisation and repolarisation on the
                 ventricular surface, as well as changing the local
                 source strength, and to inspect or document the effect
                 of such changes instantaneously on electrograms and
                 body surface potentials, visualised by waveforms as
                 well as by potential maps and movies. The entire
                 simulation package can be installed free of charge from
                 www.ecgsim.org.",
