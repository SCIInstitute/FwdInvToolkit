abstract = "Solving the inverse problem of electrocardiology via the Method of Fundamental Solutions has been proposed previously. The advantage of this approach is that it is a meshless method, so it is far easier to implement numerically than many other approaches. However, determining the heart surface potential distribution is still an ill-posed problem and thus requires some form of Tikhonov regularisation to obtain the required distributions. In this study, several methods for determining an “optimal” regularisation parameter are compared in the context of solving the inverse problem of electrocardiology via the Method of Fundamental Solutions. It is found that the Robust Generalised Cross-Validation method most often yields epicardial potential distributions with the least relative error when compared to the input distribution. The study also compares the inverse solutions obtained with the Method of Fundamental Solutions with those obtained in a previous study using the boundary element method. It is found that choosing the best solution methodology and regularisation parameter determination method depends on the particular scenario being considered."

                 ECG signals on the thorax, as well as electrograms on
                 both endocardium and epicardium. The source
                 representation of the myocardial electric activity is
                 the equivalent double layer. The transfer factors
                 between the electric sources and the resulting
                 potentials on the heart surface as well as on the body
                 surface were computed using a realistic thorax model.
                 RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The resulting transfer factors
                 were implemented in a simulation program. The program
                 allows the user to make interactive changes in the
                 timing of depolarisation and repolarisation on the
                 ventricular surface, as well as changing the local
                 source strength, and to inspect or document the effect
                 of such changes instantaneously on electrograms and
                 body surface potentials, visualised by waveforms as
                 well as by potential maps and movies. The entire
                 simulation package can be installed free of charge from
                 www.ecgsim.org.",
