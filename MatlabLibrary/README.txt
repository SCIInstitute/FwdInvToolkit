======

This directory contains a library of Matlab functions developed
at the SCI institute and the CIBC, which are provided to extend the basic Matlab
functions with code which helps in Biological Simulation Applications
and with the integration into SCIRun.

The functions in this library are organized in directories which correspond
to different projects being pursued at the SCI institute and the CIBC.

Add this directory and all the subdirectories to your matlab path to use these 
functions in SCIRun and the Fwd/Inv Toolkit.
